The webapp lives in Amazon S3.

It posts to Parse.com and to a Google Spreadsheet.

The Google sheet has a Tools > Script Editor script in it that has a REST
endpoint that listens for POST requests and writes them into the spreadsheet.

The REST endpoint also posts to Pushover.net to trigger a notification for
subscribed listeners (like Sitapati's phone).

Prahlad's iPad is subscribed to a Pushover.net Reminders app that can be used to
send him reminders.

There is also an IFTT (If This Then That) account for Prahlad with two recipes
in it, sending him Pushover reminders each day at 8am and 8pm for his Levemir.
